# COQ Metabolon: Complete Enzyme Clustering Enhances Substrate Channeling in Coenzyme Q Biosynthesis

This repository contains the computational framework and analysis tools for the research described in the paper "Complete Enzyme Clustering Enhances Substrate Channeling in Coenzyme Q Biosynthesis" by Wang et al.

## Overview

This project uses coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to investigate how metabolon formation (transient assemblies of sequential metabolic enzymes) enhances metabolic flux in the coenzyme Q (CoQ) biosynthetic pathway. The simulations model the COQ metabolon using experimentally measured protein-protein interaction strengths and demonstrate that complete enzyme clustering enables substrate channeling, dramatically enhancing CoQ production efficiency.

## Key Findings

- **Enzyme Clustering Enhances Flux**: Complete metabolon clustering dramatically improves metabolic flux through substrate channeling
- **Phase Transition Behavior**: The COQ metabolon operates at the critical region of a phase-like transition where small changes in protein-protein interaction strength can affect both enzyme clustering and metabolic output
- **Completeness Over Fine Structure**: Metabolon completeness (containing all required enzymes) rather than precise spatial arrangement is essential for efficient substrate channeling
- **Network Optimization**: The experimentally observed COQ interaction network is evolutionarily selected to promote formation of complete enzyme clusters
