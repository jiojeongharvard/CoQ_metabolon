# Enzyme Clusters and Reaction Simulation in CoQ Biosynthesis

This repository contains the computational framework and analysis tools for the research described in the paper "Complete Enzyme Clustering Enhances Substrate Channeling in Coenzyme Q Biosynthesis" by Wang et al.

## 📖 Overview

This project uses coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to investigate how metabolon formation (transient assemblies of sequential metabolic enzymes) enhances metabolic flux in the coenzyme Q (CoQ) biosynthetic pathway. The simulations model the COQ metabolon using experimentally measured protein-protein interaction strengths and demonstrate that complete enzyme clustering enables substrate channeling, dramatically enhancing CoQ production efficiency.

## 🔍 Key Findings

- **Enzyme Clustering Enhances Flux**: Complete metabolon clustering dramatically improves metabolic flux through substrate channeling
- **Phase Transition Behavior**: The COQ metabolon operates at the critical region of a phase-like transition where small changes in protein-protein interaction strength can affect both enzyme clustering and metabolic output
- **Completeness Over Fine Structure**: Metabolon completeness (containing all required enzymes) rather than precise spatial arrangement is essential for efficient substrate channeling
- **Network Optimization**: The experimentally observed COQ interaction network is evolutionarily selected to promote formation of complete enzyme clusters

## ⚙️ Simulation Model

### Coarse-Grained Representation
- **Enzymes (COQ3-7, COQ9)**: Hard spheres (radius 10 Å) with adhesive interaction sites (radius 3.5 Å) representing active sites
- **Substrates/Products**: Hard spheres (radius 1 Å) representing metabolic intermediates
- **Crowders**: Hard spheres (radius 10 Å) without active sites

### Interaction Parameters
- **Protein-protein interactions (εenz-enz)**: Based on experimentally measured Kd constants
- **Active site-substrate interactions (εpatch-lig)**: 4kT for cognate pairs, 2kT for non-cognate
- **Enzyme-substrate interactions (εenz-lig)**: 2kT (non-specific binding)

### Key Simulation Parameters
- **Temperature**: 310 K (physiological)
- **Integration timestep**: 25 fs
- **Equilibration**: 625 ns
- **Production run**: 7.5-15 μs depending on analysis
- **System size**: 800 Å cubic box
